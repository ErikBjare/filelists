filelist
========

Generate a list of all the files on your computer for faster search, backup purposes and more.

 - Simply grep the output file or search it with less to find a file you're looking for but not sure where you put it 
 - If an entire disk is lost, the knowledge of which files once existed still has a high value
 - Worried you might have put a sensitive file in a unsafe place? Look it up quickly!

There are probably faster ways to index and query the list, but this is keeping it very simple.
Also, this was fast enough for me, surprisingly.
